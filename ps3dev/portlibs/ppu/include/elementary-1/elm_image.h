 *
 * An Elementary image object is a direct realization of
 * @ref elm-image-class, and it allows one to load and display an @b image
 * file on it, be it from a disk file or from a memory
 * region. Exceptionally, one may also load an Edje group as the
 * contents of the image. In this case, though, most of the functions
 * of the image API will act as a no-op.
 *
 * One can tune various properties of the image, like:
 * - pre-scaling,
 * - smooth scaling,
 * - orientation,
 * - aspect ratio during resizes, etc.
 *
 * An image object may also be made valid source and destination for
 * drag and drop actions, through the elm_image_editable_set() call.
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 *
 * @li @c "drop" - This is called when a user has dropped an image
 *                 typed object onto the object in question -- the
 *                 event info argument is the path to that image file
 * @li @c "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the image
 *
 * An example of usage for this API follows:
 * @li @ref tutorial_image
