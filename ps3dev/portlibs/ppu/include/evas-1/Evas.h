   @section intro What is Evas?

   Evas is a clean display canvas API for several target display systems
   that can draw anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled scaled
   images, alpha-blend objects and much more.

   It abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of
   your display system are or what graphics calls are used to draw them
   and how. It deals on an object level where all you do is create and
   manipulate objects in a canvas, set their properties, and the rest is
   done for you.

   Evas optimises the rendering pipeline to minimise effort in redrawing
   changes made to the canvas and so takes this work out of the
   programmers hand, saving a lot of time and energy.

   It's small and lean, designed to work on embedded systems all the way
   to large and powerful multi-cpu workstations. It can be compiled to
   only have the features you need for your target platform if you so
   wish, thus keeping it small and lean. It has several display
   back-ends, letting it display on several display systems, making it
   portable for cross-device and cross-platform development.

   @subsection intro_not_evas What Evas is not?

   Evas is not a widget set or widget toolkit, however it is their
   base. See Elementary (http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/elementary/)
   for a toolkit based on Evas, Edje, Ecore and other Enlightenment
   technologies.

   It is not dependent or aware of main loops, input or output
   systems. Input should be polled from various sources and fed to
   Evas. Similarly, it will not create windows or report windows updates
   to your system, rather just drawing the pixels and reporting to the
   user the areas that were changed. Of course these operations are quite
   common and thus they are ready to use in Ecore, particularly in
   Ecore_Evas (http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/ecore/).


   @section work How does Evas work?

   Evas is a canvas display library. This is markedly different from most
   display and windowing systems as a canvas is structural and is also a
   state engine, whereas most display and windowing systems are immediate
   mode display targets. Evas handles the logic between a structural
   display via its state engine, and controls the target windowing system
   in order to produce rendered results of the current canvas' state on
   the display.

   Immediate mode display systems retain very little, or no state. A
   program will execute a series of commands, as in the pseudo code:

   @verbatim
   draw line from position (0, 0) to position (100, 200);

   draw rectangle from position (10, 30) to position (50, 500);

   bitmap_handle = create_bitmap();
   scale bitmap_handle to size 100 x 100;
   draw image bitmap_handle at position (10, 30);
   @endverbatim

   The series of commands is executed by the windowing system and the
   results are displayed on the screen (normally). Once the commands are
   executed the display system has little or no idea of how to reproduce
   this image again, and so has to be instructed by the application how
   to redraw sections of the screen whenever needed. Each successive
   command will be executed as instructed by the application and either
   emulated by software or sent to the graphics hardware on the device to
   be performed.

   The advantage of such a system is that it is simple, and gives a
   program tight control over how something looks and is drawn. Given the
   increasing complexity of displays and demands by users to have better
   looking interfaces, more and more work is needing to be done at this
   level by the internals of widget sets, custom display widgets and
   other programs. This means more and more logic and display rendering
   code needs to be written time and time again, each time the
   application needs to figure out how to minimise redraws so that
   display is fast and interactive, and keep track of redraw logic. The
   power comes at a high-price, lots of extra code and work.  Programmers
   not very familiar with graphics programming will often make mistakes
   at this level and produce code that is sub optimal. Those familiar
   with this kind of programming will simply get bored by writing the
   same code again and again.

   For example, if in the above scene, the windowing system requires the
   application to redraw the area from 0, 0 to 50, 50 (also referred as
   "expose event"), then the programmer must calculate manually the
   updates and repaint it again:

   @verbatim
   Redraw from position (0, 0) to position (50, 50):

   // what was in area (0, 0, 50, 50)?

   // 1. intersection part of line (0, 0) to (100, 200)?
      draw line from position (0, 0) to position (25, 50);

   // 2. intersection part of rectangle (10, 30) to (50, 500)?
      draw rectangle from position (10, 30) to position (50, 50)

   // 3. intersection part of image at (10, 30), size 100 x 100?
      bitmap_subimage = subregion from position (0, 0) to position (40, 20)
      draw image bitmap_subimage at position (10, 30);
   @endverbatim

   The clever reader might have noticed that, if all elements in the
   above scene are opaque, then the system is doing useless paints: part
   of the line is behind the rectangle, and part of the rectangle is
   behind the image. These useless paints tend to be very costly, as
   pixels tend to be 4 bytes in size, thus an overlapping region of 100 x
   100 pixels is around 40000 useless writes! The developer could write
   code to calculate the overlapping areas and avoid painting then, but
   then it should be mixed with the "expose event" handling mentioned
   above and quickly one realizes the initially simpler method became
   really complex.

   Evas is a structural system in which the programmer creates and
   manages display objects and their properties, and as a result of this
   higher level state management, the canvas is able to redraw the set of
   objects when needed to represent the current state of the canvas.

   For example, the pseudo code:

   @verbatim
   line_handle = create_line();
   set line_handle from position (0, 0) to position (100, 200);
   show line_handle;

   rectangle_handle = create_rectangle();
   move rectangle_handle to position (10, 30);
   resize rectangle_handle to size 40 x 470;
   show rectangle_handle;

   bitmap_handle = create_bitmap();
   scale bitmap_handle to size 100 x 100;
   move bitmap_handle to position (10, 30);
   show bitmap_handle;

   render scene;
   @endverbatim

   This may look longer, but when the display needs to be refreshed or
   updated, the programmer only moves, resizes, shows, hides etc. the
   objects that need to change. The programmer simply thinks at the
   object logic level, and the canvas software does the rest of the work
   for them, figuring out what actually changed in the canvas since it
   was last drawn, how to most efficiently redraw the canvas and its
   contents to reflect the current state, and then it can go off and do
   the actual drawing of the canvas.

   This lets the programmer think in a more natural way when dealing with
   a display, and saves time and effort of working out how to load and
   display images, render given the current display system etc. Since
   Evas also is portable across different display systems, this also
   gives the programmer the ability to have their code ported and
   displayed on different display systems with very little work.

   Evas can be seen as a display system that stands somewhere between a
   widget set and an immediate mode display system. It retains basic
   display logic, but does very little high-level logic such as
   scrollbars, sliders, push buttons etc.


   @section compiling How to compile using Evas ?

   Evas is a library your application links to. The procedure for this is
   very simple. You simply have to compile your application with the
   appropriate compiler flags that the @c pkg-config script outputs. For
   example:

   Compiling C or C++ files into object files:

   @verbatim
   gcc -c -o main.o main.c `pkg-config --cflags evas`
   @endverbatim

   Linking object files into a binary executable:

   @verbatim
   gcc -o my_application main.o `pkg-config --libs evas`
   @endverbatim

   You simply have to make sure that @c pkg-config is in your shell's @c
   PATH (see the manual page for your appropriate shell) and @c evas.pc
   in @c /usr/lib/pkgconfig or its path in the @c PKG_CONFIG_PATH
   environment variable. It's that simple to link and use Evas once you
   have written your code to use it.

   Since the program is linked to Evas, it is now able to use any
   advertised API calls to display graphics in a canvas managed by it, as
   well as use the API calls provided to manage data.

   You should make sure you add any extra compile and link flags to your
   compile commands that your application may need as well. The above
   example is only guaranteed to make Evas add it's own requirements.


   @section install How is it installed?

   Simple:

   @verbatim
   ./configure
   make
   su -
   ...
   make install
   @endverbatim

   @section next_steps Next Steps

   After you understood what Evas is and installed it in your system you
   should proceed understanding the programming interface for all
   objects, then see the specific for the most used elements. We'd
   recommend you to take a while to learn Ecore
   (http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/ecore/) and Edje
   (http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/edje/) as they will likely save
   you tons of work compared to using just Evas directly.

   Recommended reading:

   @li @ref Evas_Object_Group, where you'll get how to basically
    manipulate generic objects lying on an Evas canvas, handle canvas
    and object events, etc.
   @li @ref Evas_Object_Rectangle, to learn about the most basic object
    type on Evas -- the rectangle.
   @li @ref Evas_Object_Polygon, to learn how to create polygon elements
    on the canvas.
   @li @ref Evas_Line_Group, to learn how to create line elements on the
    canvas.
   @li @ref Evas_Object_Image, to learn about image objects, over which
    Evas can do a plethora of operations.
   @li @ref Evas_Object_Text, to learn how to create textual elements on
    the canvas.
   @li @ref Evas_Object_Textblock, to learn how to create multiline
    textual elements on the canvas.
   @li @ref Evas_Smart_Object_Group and @ref Evas_Smart_Group, to define
    new objects that provide @b custom functions to handle clipping,
    hiding, moving, resizing, color setting and more. These could
    be as simple as a group of objects that move together (see @ref
    Evas_Smart_Object_Clipped) up to implementations of what
    ends to be a widget, providing some intelligence (thus the name)
    to Evas objects -- like a button or check box, for example.

 * @param func The (callback) function to be called when the event is

 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to the canvas @p e when the
 * event of type @p type occurs on it. The function pointer is @p
 * func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during the addition of
 * the callback to the canvas, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_event_callback_add() as the @p
 * data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the canvas
 * pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter @p
 * event_info is a pointer to a data structure that may or may not be
 * passed to the callback, depending on the event type that triggered
 * the callback. This is so because some events don't carry extra
 * context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_POST,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_OUT,

 * event that will trigger the callback to be called. Only the last
 * two of the event types listed here provide useful event information
 * data -- a pointer to the recently focused Evas object. For the
 * others the @p event_info pointer is going to be @c NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_event_callback_add(d.canvas, EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE
 * @until two canvas event callbacks
 *
 * Looking to the callbacks registered above,

 *
 * we see that the canvas flushes its rendering pipeline
 * (#EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE) whenever the @c _resize_cb
 * routine takes place: it has to redraw that image at a different
 * size. Also, the callback on an object being focused comes just
 * after we focus it explicitly, on code.
 *
 * See the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call

 * @until }
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip let's have our events back
 * @until }
 *
 * See the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".

 * If you run that example, you'll see the canvas ignoring all input

 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The function to be called when the event is triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to an object when the event
 * of type @p type occurs on object @p obj. The function is @p func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during addition of the
 * callback to the object, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Object_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_object_event_callback_add() as
 * the @p data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the
 * canvas pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter is
 * a pointer to the object on which event occurred. Finally, the
 * fourth parameter @p event_info is a pointer to a data structure
 * that may or may not be passed to the callback, depending on the
 * event type that triggered the callback. This is so because some
 * events don't carry extra context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL,

 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED or #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED.
 *
 * This determines the kind of event that will trigger the callback.
 * What follows is a list explaining better the nature of each type of
 * event, along with their associated @p event_info pointers:
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_In struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the area
 *   (not shaded by other objects) of the object @p obj. This may
 *   occur by the mouse pointer being moved by
 *   evas_event_feed_mouse_move() calls, or by the object being shown,
 *   raised, moved, resized, or other objects being moved out of the
 *   way, hidden or lowered, whatever may cause the mouse pointer to
 *   get on top of @p obj, having been on top of another object
 *   previously.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Out struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered exactly like #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN is,
 *   but it occurs when the mouse pointer exits an object's area. Note
 *   that no mouse out events will be reported if the mouse pointer is
 *   implicitly grabbed to an object (mouse buttons are down, having
 *   been pressed while the pointer was over that object). In these
 *   cases, mouse out events will be reported once all buttons are
 *   released, if the mouse pointer has left the object's area. The
 *   indirect ways of taking off the mouse pointer from an object,
 *   like cited above, for #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, also apply here,
 *   naturally.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Down struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being pressed while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object. If the pointer mode for Evas is
 *   #EVAS_OBJECT_POINTER_MODE_AUTOGRAB (default), this causes this
 *   object to <b>passively grab the mouse</b> until all mouse buttons
 *   have been released: all future mouse events will be reported to
 *   only this object until no buttons are down. That includes mouse
 *   move events, mouse in and mouse out events, and further button
 *   presses. When all buttons are released, event propagation will
 *   occur as normal (see #Evas_Object_Pointer_Mode).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Up struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being released while
 *   the mouse pointer is over an object's area (or when passively
 *   grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Move struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse pointer being moved while
 *   over an object's area (or while passively grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Wheel struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse wheel being rolled while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object (or passively grabbed to an
 *   object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Down struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Up struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Move struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered just before Evas is about to free all
 *   memory used by an object and remove all references to it. This is
 *   useful for programs to use if they attached data to an object and
 *   want to free it when the object is deleted. The object is still
 *   valid when this callback is called, but after it returns, there
 *   is no guarantee on the object's validity.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Down struct\n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is pressed and the focus is on
 *   the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key press regardless of what object
 *   has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Up struct \n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is released and the focus is
 *   on the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key release regardless of what
 *   object has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is called when an object gains the focus. When it is
 *   called the object has already gained the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered when an object loses the focus. When it
 *   is called the object has already lost the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the object being shown by
 *   evas_object_show().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being hidden by
 *   evas_object_hide().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being
 *   moved. evas_object_move() can trigger this, as can any
 *   object-specific manipulations that would mean the object's origin
 *   could move.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being resized. Resizes can
 *   be triggered by evas_object_resize() or by any object-specific
 *   calls that may cause the object to resize.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being re-stacked. Stacking
 *   changes can be triggered by
 *   evas_object_stack_below()/evas_object_stack_above() and others.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Hold struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_object_event_callback_add(
 * @until }

 * See the full example @ref Example_Evas_Events "here".

/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Group_Map UV Mapping (Rotation, Perspective, 3D...)
 *
 * Evas allows different transformations to be applied to all kinds of
 * objects. These are applied by means of UV mapping.
 *
 * With UV mapping, one maps points in the source object to a 3D space
 * positioning at target. This allows rotation, perspective, scale and
 * lots of other effects, depending on the map that is used.
 *
 * Each map point may carry a multiplier color. If properly
 * calculated, these can do shading effects on the object, producing
 * 3D effects.
 *
 * As usual, Evas provides both the raw and easy to use methods. The
 * raw methods allow developers to create their maps somewhere else,
 * possibly loading them from some file format. The easy to use methods
 * calculate the points given some high-level parameters such as
 * rotation angle, ambient light, and so on.
 *
 * @note applying mapping will reduce performance, so use with
 *       care. The impact on performance depends on engine in
 *       use. Software is quite optimized, but not as fast as OpenGL.
 *
 * @section sec-map-points Map points
 * @subsection subsec-rotation Rotation
 *
 * A map consists of a set of points, currently only four are supported. Each
 * of these points contains a set of canvas coordinates @c x and @c y that
 * can be used to alter the geometry of the mapped object, and a @c z
 * coordinate that indicates the depth of that point. This last coordinate
 * does not normally affect the map, but it's used by several of the utility
 * functions to calculate the right position of the point given other
 * parameters.
 *
 * The coordinates for each point are set with evas_map_point_coord_set().
 * The following image shows a map set to match the geometry of an existing
 * object.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-1.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-1.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-1.eps
 *
 * This is a common practice, so there are a few functions that help make it
 * easier.
 *
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_geometry() sets the coordinates of each
 * point in the given map to match the rectangle defined by the function
 * parameters.
 *
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object() and
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object_full() both take an object and
 * set the map points to match its geometry. The difference between the two
 * is that the first function sets the @c z value of all points to 0, while
 * the latter receives the value to set in said coordinate as a parameter.
 *
 * The following lines of code all produce the same result as in the image
 * above.
 * @code
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_geometry(m, 100, 100, 200, 200, 0);
 * // Assuming o is our original object
 * evas_object_move(o, 100, 100);
 * evas_object_resize(o, 200, 200);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object_full(m, o, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Several effects can be applied to an object by simply setting each point
 * of the map to the right coordinates. For example, a simulated perspective
 * could be achieve as follows.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-2.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-2.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-2.eps
 *
 * As said before, the @c z coordinate is unused here so when setting points
 * by hand, its value is of no importance.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-3.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-3.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-3.eps
 *
 * In all three cases above, setting the map to be used by the object is the
 * same.
 * @code
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Doing things this way, however, is a lot of work that can be avoided by
 * using the provided utility functions, as described in the next section.
 *
 * @section map-utils Utility functions
 *
 * Utility functions take an already set up map and alter it to produce a
 * specific effect. For example, to rotate an object around its own center
 * you would need to take the rotation angle, the coordinates of each corner
 * of the object and do all the math to get the new set of coordinates that
 * need to tbe set in the map.
 *
 * Or you can use this code:
 * @code
 * evas_object_geometry_get(o, &x, &y, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, x + (w / 2), y + (h / 2));
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Which will rotate the object around its center point in a 45 degree angle
 * in the clockwise direction, taking it from this
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-1.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-1.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-1.eps
 *
 * to this
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-2.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-2.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-2.eps
 *
 * Objects may be rotated around any other point just by setting the last two
 * paramaters of the evas_map_util_rotate() function to the right values. A
 * circle of roughly the diameter of the object overlaid on each image shows
 * where the center of rotation is set for each example.
 *
 * For example, this code
 * @code
 * evas_object_geometry_get(o, &x, &y, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, x + w - 20, y + h - 20);
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * produces something like
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-3.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-3.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-3.eps
 *
 * And the following
 * @code
 * evas_output_size_get(evas, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, w, h);
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * rotates the object around the center of the window
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-4.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-4.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-4.eps
 *
 * @subsection subsec-3d 3D Maps
 *
 * Maps can also be used to achieve the effect of 3-dimensionality. When doing
 * this, the @c z coordinate of each point counts, with higher values meaning
 * the point is further into the screen, and smaller values (negative, usually)
 * meaning the point is closer towards the user.
 *
 * Thinking in 3D also introduces the concept of back-face of an object. An
 * object is said to be facing the user when all its points are placed in a
 * clockwise fashion. The next image shows this, with each point showing the
 * with which is identified within the map.
 *
 * @image html map-point-order-face.png
 * @image rtf map-point-order-face.png
 * @image latex map-point-order-face.eps
 *
 * Rotating this map around the @c Y axis would leave the order of the points
 * in a counter-clockwise fashion, as seen in the following image.
 *
 * @image html map-point-order-back.png
 * @image rtf map-point-order-back.png
 * @image latex map-point-order-back.eps
 *
 * This way we can say that we are looking at the back face of the object.
 * This will have stronger implications later when we talk about lighting.
 *
 * To know if a map is facing towards the user or not it's enough to use
 * the evas_map_util_clockwise_get() function, but this is normally done
 * after all the other operations are applied on the map.
 *
 * @subsection subsec-3d-rot 3D rotation and perspective
 *
 * Much like evas_map_util_rotate(), there's the function
 * evas_map_util_3d_rotate() that transforms the map to apply a 3D rotation
 * to an object. As in its 2D counterpart, the rotation can be applied around
 * any point in the canvas, this time with a @c z coordinate too. The rotation
 * can also be around any of the 3 axis.
 *
 * Starting from this simple setup
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-1.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-1.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-1.eps
 *
 * and setting maps so that the blue square to rotate on all axis around a
 * sphere that uses the object as its center, and the red square to rotate
 * around the @c Y axis, we get the following. A simple overlay over the image
 * shows the original geometry of each object and the axis around which they
 * are being rotated, with the @c Z one not appearing due to being orthogonal
 * to the screen.
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-2.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-2.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-2.eps
 *
 * which doesn't look very real. This can be helped by adding perspective
 * to the transformation, which can be simply done by calling
 * evas_map_util_3d_perspective() on the map after its position has been set.
 * The result in this case, making the vanishing point the center of each
 * object:
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-3.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-3.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-3.eps
 *
 * @section sec-color Color and lighting
 *
 * Each point in a map can be set to a color, which will be multiplied with
 * the objects own color and linearly interpolated in between adjacent points.
 * This is done with evas_map_point_color_set() for each point of the map,
 * or evas_map_util_points_color_set() to set every point to the same color.
 *
 * When using 3D effects, colors can be used to improve the looks of them by
 * simulating a light source. The evas_map_util_3d_lighting() function makes
 * this task easier by taking the coordinates of the light source and its
 * color, along with the color of the ambient light. Evas then sets the color
 * of each point based on the distance to the light source, the angle with
 * which the object is facing the light and the ambient light. Here, the
 * orientation of each point as explained before, becomes more important.
 * If the map is defined counter-clockwise, the object will be facing away
 * from the user and thus become obscured, since no light would be reflecting
 * from it.

 *
 * Images need some special handling when mapped. Evas can easily take care
 * of objects and do almost anything with them, but it's completely oblivious
 * to the content of images, so each point in the map needs to be told to what
 * pixel in the source image it belongs. Failing to do may sometimes result
 * in the expected behavior, or it may look like a partial work.
 *
 * The next image illustrates one possibility of a map being set to an image
 * object, without setting the right UV mapping for each point. The objects
 * themselves are mapped properly to their new geometry, but the image content
 * may not be displayed correctly within the mapped object.
 *
 * @image html map-uv-mapping-2.png
 * @image rtf map-uv-mapping-2.png
 * @image latex map-uv-mapping-2.eps
 *
 * Once Evas knows how to handle the source image within the map, it will
 * transform it as needed. This is done with evas_map_point_image_uv_set(),
 * which tells the map to which pixel in image it maps.
 *
 * To match our example images to the maps above all we need is the size of
 * each image, which can always be found with evas_object_image_size_get().
 *
 * @code
 * evas_map_point_image_uv_set(m, 0, 0, 0);

/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Rectangle Rectangle Object Functions
 *
 * @brief Function to create evas rectangle objects.
 *
 * There is only one function to deal with rectangle objects, this may make this
 * function seem useless given there are no functions to manipulate the created
 * rectangle, however the rectangle is actually very useful and should be
 * manipulated using the generic @ref Evas_Object_Group "evas object functions".
 *
 * The evas rectangle serves a number of key functions when working on evas
 * programs:
 * @li Background
 * @li Debugging
 * @li Clipper
 *
 * @section Background
 *
 * One extremely common requirement of evas programs is to have a solid color
 * background, this can be accomplished with the following very simple code:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *bg = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas_canvas);
 * //Here we set the rectangles red, green, blue and opacity levels
 * evas_object_color_set(bg, 255, 255, 255, 255); // opaque white background
 * evas_object_resize(bg, WIDTH, HEIGHT); // covers full canvas
 * evas_object_show(bg);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This however will have issues if the @c evas_canvas is resized, however most
 * windows are created using ecore evas and that has a solution to using the
 * rectangle as a background:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *bg = evas_object_rectangle_add(ecore_evas_get(ee));
 * //Here we set the rectangles red, green, blue and opacity levels
 * evas_object_color_set(bg, 255, 255, 255, 255); // opaque white background
 * evas_object_resize(bg, WIDTH, HEIGHT); // covers full canvas
 * evas_object_show(bg);
 * ecore_evas_object_associate(ee, bg, ECORE_EVAS_OBJECT_ASSOCIATE_BASE);
 * @endcode
 * So this gives us a white background to our window that will be resized
 * together with it.
 *
 * @section Debugging
 *
 * Debugging is a major part of any programmers task and when debugging visual
 * issues with evas programs the rectangle is an extremely useful tool. The
 * rectangle's simplicity means that it's easier to pinpoint issues with it than
 * with more complex objects. Therefore a common technique to use when writing
 * an evas program and not getting the desired visual result is to replace the
 * misbehaving object for a solid color rectangle and seeing how it interacts
 * with the other elements, this often allows us to notice clipping, parenting
 * or positioning issues. Once the issues have been identified and corrected the
 * rectangle can be replaced for the original part and in all likelihood any
 * remaining issues will be specific to that object's type.
 *
 * @section clipping Clipping
 *
 * Clipping serves two main functions:
 * @li Limiting visibility(i.e. hiding portions of an object).
 * @li Applying a layer of color to an object.
 *
 * @subsection hiding Limiting visibility
 *
 * It is often necessary to show only parts of an object, while it may be
 * possible to create an object that corresponds only to the part that must be
 * shown(and it isn't always possible) it's usually easier to use a a clipper. A
 * clipper is a rectangle that defines what's visible and what is not. The way
 * to do this is to create a solid white rectangle(which is the default, no need
 * to call evas_object_color_set()) and give it a position and size of what
 * should be visible. The following code exemplifies showing the center half of
 * @c my_evas_object:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas_canvas);
 * evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x / 4, my_evas_object_y / 4);
 * evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width / 2, my_evas_object_height / 2);
 * evas_object_clip_set(my_evas_object, clipper);
 * evas_object_show(clipper);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection color Layer of color
 *
 * In the @ref clipping section we used a solid white clipper, which produced no
 * change in the color of the clipped object, it just hid what was outside the
 * clippers area. It is however sometimes desirable to change the of color an
 * object, this can be accomplished using a clipper that has a non-white color.
 * Clippers with color work by multiplying the colors of clipped object. The
 * following code will show how to remove all the red from an object:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
 * evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x, my_evas_object_y);
 * evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width, my_evas_object_height);
 * evas_object_color_set(clipper, 0, 255, 255, 255);
 * evas_object_clip_set(obj, clipper);
 * evas_object_show(clipper);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning We don't guarantee any proper results if you create a Rectangle
 * object without setting the evas engine.
 *
 * For an example that more fully exercise the use of an evas object rectangle
 * see @ref Example_Evas_Object_Manipulation.

 * Evas' primitive object types, or to make image manipulations.
 *
 * Evas will support whichever image file types it was compiled with
 * support to (its image loaders) -- check your software packager for
 * that information and see
 * evas_object_image_extension_can_load_get().
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Basics Image object basics
 *
 * The most common use of image objects -- to display an image on the
 * canvas -- is achieved by a common function triplet:
 * @code
 * img = evas_object_image_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(img, "path/to/img", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_fill_set(img, 0, 0, w, h);
 * @endcode
 * The first function, naturally, is creating the image object. Then,
 * one must set an source file on it, so that it knows where to fetch
 * image data from. Next, one must set <b>how to fill the image
 * object's area</b> with that given pixel data. One could use just a
 * sub-region of the original image or even have it tiled repeatedly
 * on the image object. For the common case of having the whole source
 * image to be displayed on the image object, stretched to the
 * destination's size, there's also a function helper, to be used
 * instead of evas_object_image_fill_set():
 * @code
 * evas_object_image_filled_set(img, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 * See those functions' documentation for more details.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Scale Scale and resizing
 *
 * Resizing of image objects will scale their respective source images
 * to their areas, if they are set to "fill" the object's area
 * (evas_object_image_filled_set()). If the user wants any control on
 * the aspect ratio of an image for different sizes, he/she has to
 * take care of that themselves. There are functions to make images to
 * get loaded scaled (up or down) in memory, already, if the user is
 * going to use them at pre-determined sizes and wants to save
 * computations.
 *
 * Evas has even a scale cache, which will take care of caching scaled
 * versions of images with more often usage/hits. Finally, one can
 * have images being rescaled @b smoothly by Evas (more
 * computationally expensive) or not.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Performance Performance hints
 *
 * When dealing with image objects, there are some tricks to boost the
 * performance of your application, if it does intense image loading
 * and/or manipulations, as in animations on a UI.
 *
 * @subsection Evas_Object_Image_Load Load hints
 *
 * In image viewer applications, for example, the user will be looking
 * at a given image, at full size, and will desire that the navigation
 * to the adjacent images on his/her album be fluid and fast. Thus,
 * while displaying a given image, the program can be on the
 * background loading the next and previous images already, so that
 * displaying them on the sequence is just a matter of repainting the
 * screen (and not decoding image data).
 *
 * Evas addresses this issue with <b>image pre-loading</b>. The code
 * for the situation above would be something like the following:
 * @code
 * prev = evas_object_image_filled_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(prev, "/path/to/prev", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_preload(prev, EINA_TRUE);
 *
 * next = evas_object_image_filled_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(next, "/path/to/next", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_preload(next, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you're loading images which are too big, consider setting
 * previously it's loading size to something smaller, in case you
 * won't expose them in real size. It may speed up the loading
 * considerably:
 * @code
 * //to load a scaled down version of the image in memory, if that's
 * //the size you'll be displaying it anyway
 * evas_object_image_load_scale_down_set(img, zoom);
 *
 * //optional: if you know you'll be showing a sub-set of the image's
 * //pixels, you can avoid loading the complementary data
 * evas_object_image_load_region_set(img, x, y, w, h);
 * @endcode
 * Refer to Elementary's Photocam widget for a high level (smart)
 * object which does lots of loading speed-ups for you.
 *
 * @subsection Evas_Object_Image_Animation Animation hints
 *
 * If you want to animate image objects on a UI (what you'd get by
 * concomitant usage of other libraries, like Ecore and Edje), there
 * are also some tips on how to boost the performance of your
 * application. If the animation involves resizing of an image (thus,
 * re-scaling), you'd better turn off smooth scaling on it @b during
 * the animation, turning it back on afterwards, for less
 * computations. Also, in this case you'd better flag the image object
 * in question not to cache scaled versions of it:
 * @code
 * evas_object_image_scale_hint_set(wd->img, EVAS_IMAGE_SCALE_HINT_DYNAMIC);
 *
 * // resizing takes place in between
 *
 * evas_object_image_scale_hint_set(wd->img, EVAS_IMAGE_SCALE_HINT_STATIC);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Finally, movement of opaque images through the canvas is less
 * expensive than of translucid ones, because of blending
 * computations.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Borders Borders
 *
 * Evas provides facilities for one to specify an image's region to be
 * treated specially -- as "borders". This will make those regions be
 * treated specially on resizing scales, by keeping their aspect. This
 * makes setting frames around other objects on UIs easy.
 * See the following figures for a visual explanation:\n
 * @htmlonly
 * <img src="image-borders.png" style="max-width: 100%;" />
 * <a href="image-borders.png">Full-size</a>
 * @endhtmlonly

 * @endhtmlonly
 * @image rtf border-effect.png
 * @image latex border-effect.eps width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Manipulation Manipulating pixels
 *
 * Evas image objects can be used to manipulate raw pixels in many
 * ways.  The meaning of the data in the pixel arrays will depend on
 * the image's color space, be warned (see next section). You can set
 * your own data as an image's pixel data, fetch an image's pixel data
 * for saving/altering, convert images between different color spaces
 * and even advanced operations like setting a native surface as image
 * objects' data.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Color_Spaces Color spaces
 *
 * Image objects may return or accept "image data" in multiple
 * formats. This is based on the color space of an object. Here is a
 * rundown on formats:
 *
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888:
 *   This pixel format is a linear block of pixels, starting at the
 *   top-left row by row until the bottom right of the image or pixel
 *   region. All pixels are 32-bit unsigned int's with the high-byte
 *   being alpha and the low byte being blue in the format ARGB. Alpha
 *   may or may not be used by evas depending on the alpha flag of the
 *   image, but if not used, should be set to 0xff anyway.
 *   \n\n
 *   This colorspace uses premultiplied alpha. That means that R, G
 *   and B cannot exceed A in value. The conversion from
 *   non-premultiplied colorspace is:
 *   \n\n
 *   R = (r * a) / 255; G = (g * a) / 255; B = (b * a) / 255;
 *   \n\n
 *   So 50% transparent blue will be: 0x80000080. This will not be
 *   "dark" - just 50% transparent. Values are 0 == black, 255 ==
 *   solid or full red, green or blue.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_YCBCR422P601_PL:
 *   This is a pointer-list indirected set of YUV (YCbCr) pixel
 *   data. This means that the data returned or set is not actual
 *   pixel data, but pointers TO lines of pixel data. The list of
 *   pointers will first be N rows of pointers to the Y plane -
 *   pointing to the first pixel at the start of each row in the Y
 *   plane. N is the height of the image data in pixels. Each pixel in
 *   the Y, U and V planes is 1 byte exactly, packed. The next N / 2
 *   pointers will point to rows in the U plane, and the next N / 2
 *   pointers will point to the V plane rows. U and V planes are half
 *   the horizontal and vertical resolution of the Y plane.
 *   \n\n
 *   Row order is top to bottom and row pixels are stored left to
 *   right.
 *   \n\n
 *   There is a limitation that these images MUST be a multiple of 2
 *   pixels in size horizontally or vertically. This is due to the U
 *   and V planes being half resolution. Also note that this assumes
 *   the itu601 YUV colorspace specification. This is defined for
 *   standard television and mpeg streams. HDTV may use the itu709
 *   specification.
 *   \n\n
 *   Values are 0 to 255, indicating full or no signal in that plane
 *   respectively.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_YCBCR422P709_PL:
 *   Not implemented yet.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_RGB565_A5P:
 *   In the process of being implemented in 1 engine only. This may
 *   change.
 *   \n\n
 *   This is a pointer to image data for 16-bit half-word pixel data
 *   in 16bpp RGB 565 format (5 bits red, 6 bits green, 5 bits blue),
 *   with the high-byte containing red and the low byte containing
 *   blue, per pixel. This data is packed row by row from the top-left
 *   to the bottom right.
 *   \n\n
 *   If the image has an alpha channel enabled there will be an extra
 *   alpha plane after the color pixel plane. If not, then this data
 *   will not exist and should not be accessed in any way. This plane
 *   is a set of pixels with 1 byte per pixel defining the alpha
 *   values of all pixels in the image from the top-left to the bottom
 *   right of the image, row by row. Even though the values of the
 *   alpha pixels can be 0 to 255, only values 0 through to 32 are
 *   used, 32 being solid and 0 being transparent.
 *   \n\n
 *   RGB values can be 0 to 31 for red and blue and 0 to 63 for green,
 *   with 0 being black and 31 or 63 being full red, green or blue
 *   respectively. This colorspace is also pre-multiplied like
 *   EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888 so:
 *   \n\n
 *   R = (r * a) / 32; G = (g * a) / 32; B = (b * a) / 32;
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_GRY8:
 *   The image is just a alpha mask (8 bit's per pixel). This is used
 *   for alpha masking.
 *
 * @warning We don't guarantee any proper results if you create a Image object
 * without setting the evas engine.
 *
 * Some examples on this group of functions can be found @ref
 * Example_Evas_Images "here".

/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Textblock Textblock Object Functions
 *
 * Functions used to create and manipulate textblock objects. Unlike
 * @ref Evas_Object_Text, these handle complex text, doing multiple
 * styles and multiline text based on HTML-like tags. Of these extra
 * features will be heavier on memory and processing cost.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Textblock_Tutorial Textblock Object Tutorial
 *
 * This part explains about the textblock object's API and proper usage.
 * The main user of the textblock object is the edje entry object in Edje, so
 * that's a good place to learn from, but I think this document is more than
 * enough, if it's not, please contact me and I'll update it.
 *
 * @subsection textblock_intro Introduction
 * The textblock objects is, as implied, an object that can show big chunks of
 * text. Textblock supports many features including: Text formatting, automatic
 * and manual text alignment, embedding items (for example icons) and more.
 * Textblock has three important parts, the text paragraphs, the format nodes
 * and the cursors.
 *
 * You can use markup to format text, for example: "<font_size=50>Big!</font_size>".
 * You can also put more than one style directive in one tag:
 * "<font_size=50 color=#F00>Big and Red!</font_size>".
 * Please notice that we used "</font_size>" although the format also included
 * color, this is because the first format determines the matching closing tag's
 * name. You can also use anonymous tags, like: "<font_size=30>Big</>" which
 * just pop any type of format, but it's advised to use the named alternatives
 * instead.
 *
 * @subsection textblock_cursors Textblock Object Cursors
 * A textblock Cursor is data type that represents
 * a position in a textblock. Each cursor contains information about the
 * paragraph it points to, the position in that paragraph and the object itself.
 * Cursors register to textblock objects upon creation, this means that once
 * you created a cursor, it belongs to a specific obj and you can't for example
 * copy a cursor "into" a cursor of a different object. Registered cursors
 * also have the added benefit of updating automatically upon textblock changes,
 * this means that if you have a cursor pointing to a specific character, it'll
 * still point to it even after you change the whole object completely (as long
 * as the char was not deleted), this is not possible without updating, because
 * as mentioned, each cursor holds a character position. There are many
 * functions that handle cursors, just check out the evas_textblock_cursor*
 * functions. For creation and deletion of cursors check out:
 * @see evas_object_textblock_cursor_new()
 * @see evas_textblock_cursor_free()
 * @note Cursors are generally the correct way to handle text in the textblock object, and there are enough functions to do everything you need with them (no need to get big chunks of text and processing them yourself).
 *
 * @subsection textblock_paragraphs Textblock Object Paragraphs
 * The textblock object is made out of text splitted to paragraphs (delimited
 * by the paragraph separation character). Each paragraph has many (or none)
 * format nodes associated with it which are responsible for the formatting
 * of that paragraph.
 *
 * @subsection textblock_format_nodes Textblock Object Format Nodes
 * As explained in @ref textblock_paragraphs each one of the format nodes
 * is associated with a paragraph.
 * There are two types of format nodes, visible and invisible:
 * Visible: formats that a cursor can point to, i.e formats that
 * occupy space, for example: newlines, tabs, items and etc. Some visible items
 * are made of two parts, in this case, only the opening tag is visible.
 * A closing tag (i.e a \</tag\> tag) should NEVER be visible.
 * Invisible: formats that don't occupy space, for example: bold and underline.
 * Being able to access format nodes is very important for some uses. For
 * example, edje uses the "<a>" format to create links in the text (and pop
 * popups above them when clicked). For the textblock object a is just a
 * formatting instruction (how to color the text), but edje utilizes the access
 * to the format nodes to make it do more.
 * For more information, take a look at all the evas_textblock_node_format_*
 * functions.
 * The translation of "<tag>" tags to actual format is done according to the
 * tags defined in the style, see @ref evas_textblock_style_set
 *
 * @subsection textblock_special_formats Special Formats
 * Textblock supports various format directives that can be used in markup. In
 * addition to the mentioned format directives, textblock allows creating
 * additional format directives using "tags" that can be set in the style see
 * @ref evas_textblock_style_set .
 *
 * Textblock supports the following formats:
 * @li font - Font description in fontconfig like format, e.g: "Sans:style=Italic:lang=hi". or "Serif:style=Bold".
 * @li font_weight - Overrides the weight defined in "font". E.g: "font_weight=Bold" is the same as "font=:style=Bold". Supported weights: "normal", "thin", "ultralight", "light", "book", "medium", "semibold", "bold", "ultrabold", "black", and "extrablack".
 * @li font_style - Overrides the style defined in "font". E.g: "font_style=Italic" is the same as "font=:style=Italic". Supported styles: "normal", "oblique", and "italic".
 * @li font_width - Overrides the width defined in "font". E.g: "font_width=Condensed" is the same as "font=:style=Condensed". Supported widths: "normal", "ultracondensed", "extracondensed", "condensed", "semicondensed", "semiexpanded", "expanded", "extraexpanded", and "ultraexpanded".
 * @li lang - Overrides the language defined in "font". E.g: "lang=he" is the same as "font=:lang=he".
 * @li font_fallbacks - A comma delimited list of fonts to try if finding the main font fails.
 * @li font_size - The font size in points.
 * @li font_source - The source of the font, e.g an eet file.
 * @li color - Text color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li underline_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li underline2_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li outline_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li shadow_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li glow_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li glow2_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li strikethrough_color - color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li align - Either "auto" (meaning according to text direction), "left", "right", "center", "middle", a value between 0.0 and 1.0, or a value between 0% to 100%.
 * @li valign - Either "top", "bottom", "middle", "center", "baseline", "base", a value between 0.0 and 1.0, or a value between 0% to 100%.
 * @li wrap - "word", "char", "mixed", or "none".
 * @li left_margin - Either "reset", or a pixel value indicating the margin.
 * @li right_margin - Either "reset", or a pixel value indicating the margin.
 * @li underline - "on", "off", "single", or "double".
 * @li strikethrough - "on" or "off"
 * @li backing_color - Background color in one of the following formats: "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "#RGB", and "#RGBA".
 * @li backing - Enable/disable background color. ex) "on" or "off"
 * @li style - Either "off", "none", "plain", "shadow", "outline", "soft_outline", "outline_shadow", "outline_soft_shadow", "glow", "far_shadow", "soft_shadow", or "far_soft_shadow".
 * @li tabstops - Pixel value for tab width.
 * @li linesize - Force a line size in pixels.
 * @li linerelsize - Either a floating point value or a percentage indicating the wanted size of the line relative to the calculated size.
 * @li linegap - Force a line gap in pixels.
 * @li linerelgap - Either a floating point value or a percentage indicating the wanted size of the line relative to the calculated size.
 * @li item - Creates an empty space that should be filled by an upper layer. Use "size", "abssize", or "relsize". To define the items size, and an optional: vsize=full/ascent to define the item's position in the line.
 * @li linefill - Either a float value or percentage indicating how much to fill the line.
 * @li ellipsis - Value between 0.0-1.0 to indicate the type of ellipsis, or -1.0 to indicate ellipsis isn't wanted.
 * @li password - "on" or "off". This is used to specifically turn replacing chars with the replacement char (i.e password mode) on and off.
 *
 * @warning We don't guarantee any proper results if you create a Textblock
 * object
 * without setting the evas engine.

 * that if the size required by the children, which is given by their
 * widths and the @c padding_h property of the box, is bigger than the
 * their container's width, the children will be displayed out of the
 * box's bounds. A negative value of @c align_h makes the box to
 * @b justify its children. The padding between them, in this case, is

 * @b don't contribute to its behaviour when this layout is chosen.
 *
 * \par Child element's properties:
 * @c align_x does @b not influence the box's behavior. @c padding_l
 * and @c padding_r sum up to the container's horizontal padding
 * between elements. The child's @c padding_t, @c padding_b and
 * @c align_y properties apply for padding/alignment relative to the
 * overall height of the box. Finally, there is the @c weight_x
 * property, which, if set to a non-zero value, tells the container
 * that the child width is @b not pre-defined. If the container can't
 * accommodate all its children, it sets the widths of the ones
 * <b>with weights</b> to sizes as small as they can all fit into
 * it. If the size required by the children is less than the
 * available, the box increases its childrens' (which have weights)
 * widths as to fit the remaining space. The @c weight_x property,
 * besides telling the element is resizable, gives a @b weight for the
 * resizing process.  The parent box will try to distribute (or take
 * off) widths accordingly to the @b normalized list of weigths: most
 * weighted children remain/get larger in this process than the least
 * ones. @c weight_y does not influence the layout.
 *
 * If one desires that, besides having weights, child elements must be
 * resized bounded to a minimum or maximum size, those size hints must
 * be set, by the <c>evas_object_size_hint_{min,max}_set()</c>

 * alignment will be considered as 0.5. This is the default.
 *
 * @todo @c EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_NONE should balance weight.
 *
 * @par EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_TABLE
 * When homogeneous is relative to table the own table size is divided
 * equally among children, filling the whole table area. That is, if
 * table has @c WIDTH and @c COLUMNS, each cell will get <tt>WIDTH /
 * COLUMNS</tt> pixels. If children have minimum size that is larger
 * than this amount (including padding), then it will overflow and be
 * aligned respecting the alignment hint, possible overlapping sibling
 * cells. @b Weight hint is used as a boolean, if greater than zero it
 * will make the child expand in that axis, taking as much space as
 * possible (bounded to maximum size hint). Negative alignment will be
 * considered as 0.5.
 *
 * @par EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_ITEM
 * When homogeneous is relative to item it means the greatest minimum
 * cell size will be used. That is, if no element is set to expand,
 * the table will have its contents to a minimum size, the bounding
 * box of all these children will be aligned relatively to the table
 * object using evas_object_table_align_get(). If the table area is
 * too small to hold this minimum bounding box, then the objects will
 * keep their size and the bounding box will overflow the box area,
 * still respecting the alignment. @b Weight hint is used as a
 * boolean, if greater than zero it will make that cell expand in that
 * axis, toggling the <b>expand mode</b>, which makes the table behave
 * much like @b EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_TABLE, except that the
 * bounding box will overflow and items will not overlap siblings. If
 * no minimum size is provided at all then the table will fallback to

 * @defgroup Evas_Keys Key Input Functions
 *
 * Functions which feed key events to the canvas.
 *
 * As explained in @ref intro_not_evas, Evas is @b not aware of input
 * systems at all. Then, the user, if using it crudely (evas_new()),
 * will have to feed it with input events, so that it can react
 * somehow. If, however, the user creates a canvas by means of the
 * Ecore_Evas wrapper, it will automatically bind the chosen display
 * engine's input events to the canvas, for you.
 *
 * This group presents the functions dealing with the feeding of key
 * events to the canvas. On most of them, one has to reference a given
 * key by a name (<code>keyname</code> argument). Those are
 * <b>platform dependent</b> symbolic names for the keys. Sometimes
 * you'll get the right <code>keyname</code> by simply using an ASCII
 * value of the key name, but it won't be like that always.
 *
 * Typical platforms are Linux frame buffer (Ecore_FB) and X server
 * (Ecore_X) when using Evas with Ecore and Ecore_Evas. Please refer
 * to your display engine's documentation when using evas through an
 * Ecore helper wrapper when you need the <code>keyname</code>s.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip mods = evas_key_modifier_get(evas);
 * @until {
 *
 * All the other @c evas_key functions behave on the same manner. See
